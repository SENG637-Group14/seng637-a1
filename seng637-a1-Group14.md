# Introduction

This report shares our group's experience testing the ATM simulation system for the Lab. Before this lab, a couple of us mostly knew about software testing from theory. We thought exploratory testing was just a freeform way to check how a system behaves, while manual functional testing seemed more structured, following specific test cases. But actually doing these tests gave us a much clearer picture. We got hands-on experience with both methods, which helped us understand how they work in real-world software quality assurance.
